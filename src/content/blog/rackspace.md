In this role, I am responsible for a wide range of tasks within the cloud domain as the first line of response to customers. Many issues can be resolved quickly with a few questions, such as DNS record configurations and basic troubleshooting for servers, whether they are dedicated (private) or public cloud servers hosted on Rackspace.

Additionally, I must be familiar with all services provided by AWS, GCP, and Azure to identify whether a problem is related to infrastructure or the operating system. In cases related to the operating system, I check the status of the server's virtual components (RAM, CPU usage, Memory Usage, Inodes, PowerStatus, outdated programs, etc.). Based on this assessment, I determine whether I can resolve the issue quickly or if it is more effective to route the case to an identified specialist or engineer.

It is also common to encounter connection issues caused by VPN or firewall rules from various brands such as Palo Alto or Cisco. For these, I perform basic troubleshooting or route them to specialists. While handling multiple customer requests, I also answer calls from clients worldwide, providing dedicated attention to those waiting on the phone.

I also follow up on SSL purchases based on DNR certificates generated using Rackspace-provided tools. These are important for managing websites, their domains, and DNS.

A fundamental aspect of my position as a support technician at Rackspace is identifying the severity of the presented problem, such as critical, urgent, or standard. For example, an urgent status refers to servers that are down, frozen, or experiencing flapping issues, leading to downtimes in the clients' production. These clients might be hosting websites, e-commerce platforms, databases, management systems, real-time strategic information exchanges, etc., which require immediate attention.

As the first line of response, it is my duty to identify the problem so that the specialist can work on it without delays, providing them with all the context and technical issues found. I also proactively inform the client about the existing problem, letting them know that it is already under investigation and being worked on for a quick resolution.

Urgent issues are similar in that they can lead to production downtimes but are less critical, such as maintenance, minor memory space concerns that do not directly affect operations, or brief disconnections. These are prioritized over standard daily requests.

Within standard requests, I handle password resets in Linux and Windows operating systems, either directly with root users or Active Directory domains or local servers. Since a client's infrastructure may include local administration services, mesh networks, or even super-server hosting environments, I need to manage a diverse range of configurations and services.

Rackspace offers a variety of services to its dedicated customers, such as CDN, CloudFiles, CloudStorage, DNS, Snapshots, virtual server creation, and monitoring. I must be familiar with all these services to provide guidance and support to the customer and identify problems that may not have been mentioned by them. This means my customer service skills must focus on understanding that the client may not always be sure of what they are reporting.
